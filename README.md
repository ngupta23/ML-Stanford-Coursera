# ML-Stanford-Coursera
Machine Learning Course (Andrew Ng, Stanford) from Coursera 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome

This reporsitoy includes all the programming exercises from the course.
The programs were written in Octave

**Exercises include following algorithms**
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Neural Networks
4. Support Vector Machines
5. K-means Clustering
6. Anomaly Detection
7. Recommender Systems

**Concepts applied**
1. Vectorize the code whenever possible - especially in ex7 (image compression and clustering). The difference in execution between non vectorized and vectorized was immense. Totally worth the time to implement the vectorized code! 
2. Feature Scaling - When to use
3. Regularization - Application, Finding the optimim value
4. Cost Function and Gradient calculations
5. Use of advanced learning algorithms
6. Debugging the model using learning curves - Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance
7. Train/Cross Validation/Test set application
8. Dimensionality Reduction - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
9. Kernels as applied to SVM
